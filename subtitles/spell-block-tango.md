现在是六名亢奋的凶杀犯\
And now the six merry murderesses of the Captain Hook County Jail\
在虎克船长监狱的《咒语探戈》表演\
in their rendition of the Spell Block Tango

他自找的\
He had it coming\
他自作孽 不可活\
He only had himself to be blame\
如果你也在场\
If you'd have been there\
如果你目睹了一切\
if you'd seen it\
我打赌你也会这么做\
I bet you you would have done the same

你知道 有些人就是让你失望\
You know how people have these little habits that get you down\
比如贾斯珀和贺瑞斯\
like Jasper and Horace\
他们对布料一无所知\
they didn't know their fabrics\
我要的是斑点纹\
I asked for spots\
不 不是条纹\
No not stripes\
也不是波点\
not dots\
是斑点\
spots\
我非常生气的去找他们\
So I came on this one day and I'm really irritated\
指望能有一点安慰\
And I'm looking for a little bit sympathy\
结果看见贾斯珀和贺瑞斯\
and there's Jasper and Horace\
躺在沙发上 喝着啤酒\
lying on the couch drinking a beer\
旁边放着十码的波点布\
with ten yards of dotted fabric\
不 不是斑点\
No not spots\
是波点\
dots\
于是我说 你再给我买一次波点\
So I said to them I said you buy me dots one more time\
他们又买了\
and they did\
所以我拿了墙上的猎枪\
So l took the shotgun off the wall\
开了两枪警告\
and I fired two warning shots\
朝他们的脑袋\
into their heads

两年前 我在很远的地方遇见了多克\
I met Doc in a faraway land about two years ago\
他说他是单身\
He told me he was single\
我们很快坠入了爱河\
and we hit it off right away\
然后开始同居\
So we started living together\
他去宝石矿工作 回家唱Heigh-Ho\
He'd go to work and little jewel mines and come home singing Heigh-Ho\
我会给他倒喝的\
I'd fix him a drink\
我们一起吃晚餐\
we'd have dinner\
结果我发现 他说的单身\
and then I found out the single he told me\
单身个锤子\
single my glass\
他不仅已经结婚了\
Not only was he married\
还有六个男人\
Oh no he had six men\
他是小矮人之一\
One of those dwarfs\
你知道吗\
you know\
那天他下班回家后\
So that night when he came home from work\
我照样给他准备了喝的\
I fixed him a drink as usual\
有些人就是等不及要喝手中的苹果汁\
You know some guys just can't hold their apple juice

他自找的\
He had it coming\
他自找的\
He had it coming\
他摘下盛放的花\
He took a flower in its prime\
却利用它\
And then he used it\
摧残它\
And he abused it\
这是凶杀 但不是犯罪\
It was a murder but not a crime\


我站在大锅旁边\
Now I'm standing over the cauldron\
调制着晚餐的鲶鱼\
mixing up some catfish for dinner\
忙着自己的事\
minding my own business\
艾瑞克王子突然冲进来 妒火中烧\
In storms Prince Eric in a jealous rage\
你和川顿国王有一腿\
You've been screwin King Trenton he says\
简直疯了\
It was crazy\
他继续大叫 你一直在跟川顿国王乱搞\
and he kept on screaming you've been screwing King Trenton\
然后就撞向了我的触手\
and then he ran into my tentacles\
他撞向我的触手八次\
He ran into my tentacles eight times\
如果你也在场 如果你目睹了一切\
If you'd been there, if you'd seen it\
我打赌你也会这么做\
I bet you you would have done the same

一个接一个地空翻\
flip flops one right after the other\
所以这次表演的前一晚\
So this one night before the show\
我去了费加罗酒店\
I go down to the hotel Figaro\
和鬣狗们玩了几圈\
hanging with the hyenas having a few laps\
追的斑马用完了\

所以我出去弄几匹\

等到洞穴后\
and I come back into the den\
我看见沙拉碧和木法沙在做17式\
and there's Sarabiand Mufasa doing number 17\
雄鹰展翅\
the spread eagle\
我疯了\
Well I was in such a state of shock\
直接昏了过去\
I completely blacked out\
什么都不记得了\
I don't remember a thing\
醒来就发现在洗爪子上的血\
It wasn't untit later when i was washing the blood off my paws\
才知道他们已经死了

体贴 满怀壮志\
Sensitive and full of wishes\

他找到了弗罗拉 芳娜 还有梅里韦瑟\

我猜 我们分手是因为我们的艺术差异\
I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences\
他认为自己是活物\
He saw himself as alive\
而我视他为死物\
And I saw him dead
