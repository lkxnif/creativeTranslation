You know how people have these little habits that get you down

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,666
like Jasper and Horace

54
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,466
they didn't know their fabrics

55
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,133
I asked for spots

56
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,400
No not stripes 

57
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,370
not dots

spots

59
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,850
So I came on this one day

60
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,000
and I'm really irritated

61
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,030
And I'm looking for a little bit sympathy

62
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,900
and there's Jasper and Horace

63
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,933
lying on the couch drinking a beer

64
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,700
with ten yards of dotted fabric

65
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,600
No not spots

66
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,133
dots

67
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,867
So I said to them I said you buy me dots one more time

68
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,333
and they did

69
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,402
So l took the shotgun off the wall

70
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,400
and I fired two warning shots

71
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:53,133
into their heads

72
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,033
They had it coming

73
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:56,933
They had it coming

74
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:01,233

I met Doc in a faraway land about two years ago

93
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,269
He told me he was single

94
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,433
and we hit it off right away

95
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,267
So we started living together

96
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:29,533
He'd go to work and little jewel mines and come home singing Heigh Ho

97
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,325
I'd fix him a drink

98
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,433
we'd have dinner

99
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,267
and then I found out the single he told me

100
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,600
single my glass

101
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Not only was he married

102
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,733
Oh no he had six men

103
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,440
One of those dwarfs

104
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,033
you know

105
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,500
So that night when he came home from work

106
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:51,000
I fixed him a drink as usual

107
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:56,000
You know some guys just can't hold their apple juice

108
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,825
He had it coming

109
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,000
He had it coming

110
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,133
He took a flower in its prime

111
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,500
And then he used it

112
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,433
And he abused it

113
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:11,500
It was a murder but not a crime

114
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,400
·

115
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,633
Now I'm standing over the cauldron

116
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,500
mixing up some catfish for dinner

117
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,400
minding my own business

118
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000

You've been screwin King Trenton he says

120
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,800
It was crazy

121
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,233
and he kept on screaming you've been screwing King Trenton

122
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,667
and then he ran into my tentacles

123
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,000
He ran into my tentacles eight times

124
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,800
If you'd been there, if you'd seen it

125
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,800
I bet you you would have done the same

130
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,867
Ah-ah, not guilty

131
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:16,267
My brother Mufasa and I had this exact

132
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,066
And my lady Sarabi used to tag along with us

133
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,733
Never the last number in our act

134
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,900
we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row

135
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,433
One two three four five splits spread eagle back flips

136
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,267
flip flops one right after the other

137
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,300
So this one night before the show

138
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,733
I go down to the hotel Figaro

139
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,533
hanging with the hyenas having a few laps

140
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,333
and they run out of zebra

141
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,500
So I ran out to get some

142
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,867
and I come back into the den

143
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,700
and there's Sarabiand Mufasa doing number 17

144
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,800
the spread eagle

145
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,067
Well I was in such a state of shock

146
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,633
I completely blacked out

147
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,933
I don't remember a thing

148
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,800
It wasn't untit later when i was washing the blood off my paws

149
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,867
Ieven knew they were dead

150
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,000
They had it coming

151
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,733
They had it coming all the long

152
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,683
I didn't do it

153
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:12,700
He didn't do it

154
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,625
But if I had done it

155
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,600
But if he had done it

156
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,100
How could you tell me that I was wrong

157
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:24,100
They had it coming

158
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,933
They had it coming all the long

159
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,900
I didn't do it

160
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,867
He didn't do it

161
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,800
But if i had done it

162
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,033
How could you tell me that I was wrong

163
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,400
I loved King Stefan more than you could possibly say

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,500
He was an artistic guy

165
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,833
Sensitive and full of wishes

166
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,400
But he was always trying to find himself

167
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,467
He'd go out every night looking for himself and on the way

168
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:54,933
He found Flora Fauna and Merryweather

169
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,800
I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences

170
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
He saw himself as alive

171
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,833
And I saw him dead

172
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:11,933
The dirty bam bam bam bam bam bam

173
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:15,667
They had it coming

174
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,067
They had it coming all the long

175
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,267
Cause if they use it
