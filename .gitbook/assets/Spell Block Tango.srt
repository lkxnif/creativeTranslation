56
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,133
我要的是斑点纹

It wasn't untit later when i was washing the blood off my paws

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,867
我甚至还知道他们已经死了

152
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,000
他们自找的
They had it coming

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,733
都是他们自作自受
They had it coming all the long

我没做

他没做

但如果他真的做了
But if he had done it

158

怎么能说我做错了呢

159
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:24,100
他们自找的

他没做

163
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,800
但如果我真的做了

敏感 充满愿望

168
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,400
但他总是在寻找自我

169
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,467
他每晚都会出去寻找自我

171
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,800
可以说我们分手是因为在艺术上的差异
I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences

172
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
他将自己视作鲜活
He saw himself as alive

173
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,833
我视他为死物

174
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:11,933
说不尽的下流事

他们自找的
They had it coming

176
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,067
一切都是他们自作自受
They had it coming all the long

177
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,267
如果他们利用仇恨
Cause if they use it

178
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,200
我也可以利用仇恨
I may have use it

179
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,667
怎么能说我们错了呢

一切都是他自作孽 不可活

182
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,667
如果你也在场

如果你目睹一切

184
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,700
我打赌你也会这样做
